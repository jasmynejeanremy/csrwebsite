                <h3>By: Cagan Hawthorne</h3>
                <p class="lead">Scratch is a free, easy to use programming language designed by MIT to introduce young learners to computer science concepts. With Scratch, you can program games, animations, and more; as well as share them with an active online community. Scratch is an excellent tool for introducing kids to the world of programming and computer science.</p>

                <h4>What is in this tutorial?</h4>
		<p>In this tutorial, we will cover some basic tools for making games using Scratch. Some things that will be covered include player-controlled movement, sprite animation, timers, cloning, random enemy movement, and game over states. In doing this, we will introduce essential computer science concepts such as if statements, loops, and variables. At the end of this tutorial, students will be able to create a simple asteroid dodging game, similar to the one in this reference: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/478777220/ If you are ever lost in the tutorial, feel free to go to the reference project and click the “See Inside” button to look at the code and comments. </p>
            	<h4>Getting Started</h4>
		<p>Already familiar with the basics of Scratch? Feel free to skip to the video tutorial!

			While you do not need a Scratch account to make a game, you will need one if you wish to save your work. You can make a Scratch account here: https://scratch.mit.edu/join

			To start your first project, simply head to https://scratch.mit.edu/ and click “Create” in the top left corner. 

			Scratch uses 3 different panels on the creation screen. The leftmost panel contains all of the code blocks that you can use to create your program. The middle panel, which is blank at the start of a new project, is where you will drag and drop your code blocks to make your program. Finally, the right panel contains a preview screen of your program, which you can use to test your code, as well as a collection of the sprites you are using for your program. Be sure to familiarize yourself with this interface before starting the tutorial.
