                <p class="lead">In this changing world, our online presence continues to increase. Children are encouraged to become familiar with online interfaces and tools at a young age as a result of the rise of the Internet. Here are some fun activities to do online with your kids while allowing them to learn more about STEM!</p>

                        <br/>
                        <p> Originally by Microsoft Research, it’s creators state that, 
                            “Kodu Game Lab is a 3D game development environment that is 
                            designed to teach kids basic programming principles”. 
                            Children between the ages of 7 to 13 can utilize this 
                            tool to learn more about coding as well as get their 
                            creative juices flowing by building worlds and characters 
                            of their design. Kodu can be used to teach creativity, 
                            problem solving, storytelling, as well as programming. 
                            Who knows? Maybe parents can learn something too!</p>

                        <p> This is the origin of many coders who have gone on to code great things. Scratch is a platform designed specifically for kids between the ages of 8 to 16, but it can be used by anyone to learn the fundamentals of coding. Scratch users can program their own interactive stories, animations, and games while also having the option of sharing them on the Scratch online community. Whether being entertained with the plentiful games and resources available on the Scratch online community or programming one yourself, Scratch is a great platform for parents and children alike to foster an interest in coding! Look at the tutorial by one of our very own below for more guidance!</p>
