                        <h3>Knitting/Crocheting</h3>
                        <p>If you have some yarn around the house, knitting and crocheting are good ways to relax and make something, and it’s a great way to make presents. 

                            Here’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/hM5M2Fu0RtY?t=160">video</a> of how to knit for beginners. To see if you like it, start out with some regular yarn and you can use pens or pencils as improvised knitting needles, as long as they have a similar shape to knitting needles. 
                            
                            Crochet is like knitting, but with one hook instead of two needles, which lets you do more things freestyle once you have some experience. You will need  some yarn, and you can start by using your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvfeHjFFmZk">fingers</a>! 
                            You can also crochet using a crochet hook; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAxGTnVNJiE">here's</a> where to learn how. </p>
                            <p>
                                There are lots of patterns for knitting and crocheting projects available online or on YouTube, so search around and see what looks fun!

Here are some tips for beginner hikers, if you want more advice before you get started! </p>
